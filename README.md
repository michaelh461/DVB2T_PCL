# DVB2T_PCL
Code repository for all DVB-T2 direct signal cancellation and Range-Doppler processing algorithms developed for the EEE4022S Thesis Project course at the University of Cape Town

Note: This code makes use of additional files which are part of the overall PCL system at the University of Cape Town. This includes code for reading in of data (RCF files), which are not mine to distribute, particularly on a public platform. Please contact either myself, Francois Schonken or Stephen Paine in the UCT RRSG group for information on how to use this code.
